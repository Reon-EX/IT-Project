    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
        This short film is a story about the other side of student daily life that is not seen by others. 
        The financial struggle, broken home situations, toxic friendships, mental health issues, and romantic relationship 
        problems are burdens that students face alongside their academic challenges. This story aims to reveal the hidden 
        struggles students go through daily.
    </p>
    <p>
        The goal of making this project is to spread awareness among students and those around them that sometimes 
        what we see on the outside isn't the whole truth. We must stay aware and be ready to help one another, including 
        ourselves. The story is inspired by real-life student experiences happening today.
